# europe-map

An illustrator map of Europe that can be used in your projects

The original version of this map was made by the auhtor as part of a project for the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA), an agency of the European Union, in Lisbon. The project may be seen here: http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/publications/topic-overviews/policy-evaluation_en

To use this map in your projects you will need a vector graphic software capable of reading the file -- Adobe Illustrator but it may work in InkScape (https://inkscape.org/en/)

Widely available fonts (Helvetica Neue and Bookman Old Style) have been used but can easily be changed.

Most objects (maps, text, data) have been placed in separate layers to make it easier to modify.

The main advantage of using this map is that it provides you with a STARTING MAP OF EUROPE in vector graphic format.

You're free to use it in any of your projects, commercial or otherwise. No attribution is necessary.

The original map was created using the D3 framework (https://d3js.org). Shape files were obtained from Natural Earth http://www.naturalearthdata.com

The projection used is an Lambert azimuthal equal-area projection. This projection is recommended by Eurostat. It preserves areas but introduces distorsions in angles
